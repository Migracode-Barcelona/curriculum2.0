These exercises are hosted on the GitHub repository of our partner NGO, **Code Your Future** (UK), and **not** on a MigraCode-owned repository. We are part of a European network where we share resources and support each other as we share the same mission - to provide free, high-quality tech education to our communities.

The exercises work as intended â€” you are free to **fork and clone** the repository as usual, if required by the exercise.

However, please do not make any pull requests to the original Code Your Future repository.
