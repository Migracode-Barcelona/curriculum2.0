# 🛡️ Safeguarding at MigraCode

At MigraCode, creating a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment is essential. We work with people from diverse backgrounds—often in vulnerable situations—and we are committed to protecting the **health, well-being, and human rights** of everyone involved: students, volunteers, and staff.

Safeguarding means taking **all necessary steps to prevent harm, abuse, or neglect**—and knowing how to act if concerns arise.

## 🧠 What is a Safeguarding Concern?

**Safeguarding is not only about preventing physical or sexual violence.**  
It also includes **protecting emotional well-being, personal boundaries, and dignity** in everyday interactions.

Examples of safeguarding concerns can include:

- A volunteer or teacher **undermining your confidence or creating a tense atmosphere**
- Feeling **excluded or belittled** in group settings
- Someone **crossing emotional boundaries** (e.g., oversharing, invasive questions, guilt-tripping)
- Any behavior that makes you feel **unsafe, uncomfortable, or disrespected**
- Discrimination or harassment of any kind (verbal, emotional, physical, or online)

You do **not need to be sure** that something is a safeguarding issue — if it feels off or “not okay,” it’s worth mentioning.

## 🛡️ Safe & Anonymous Reporting

You can report a concern:
- **Verbally** to a trusted staff member or Safeguarding Committee member
- **Through the anonymous [report form](https://airtable.com/appbRpCtQ1p9CP6Jd/shrz8nmrNMu4K71lo)** — no login or personal details required
- **Via the module feedback forms**, especially if you're unsure where to start

> **Reporting will never lead to consequences for the person raising the concern** — whether it's a misunderstanding, a small issue, or something more serious.  
>  
> You will always be treated with **respect, confidentiality, and care.**

We believe that addressing concerns **early**—even small ones—is the best way to protect everyone’s well-being.

## 🧍 For Students

As a student, you are **not responsible for judging whether something is a safeguarding issue**. Your role is simply to **speak up** when something feels off.

### ✅ You can report a concern:
- To your instructor or mentor
- To a Safeguarding Committee member
- By filling out the [report form](https://airtable.com/appbRpCtQ1p9CP6Jd/shrz8nmrNMu4K71lo)
- Anonymously, if needed

You can also use the **feedback form** after each module to raise minor concerns, even if you're unsure it's a safeguarding issue.

> _We might also check in with you during meetings or classes—this is just part of how we make sure everyone is okay._
