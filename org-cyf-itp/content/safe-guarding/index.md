# 🛡️ Safeguarding at MigraCode

At MigraCode, creating a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment is essential. We work with people from diverse backgrounds—often in vulnerable situations—and we are committed to protecting the **health, well-being, and human rights** of everyone involved: students, volunteers, and staff.

Safeguarding means taking **all necessary steps to prevent harm, abuse, or neglect**—and knowing how to act if concerns arise.

## 🧠 What is a Safeguarding Concern?

**Safeguarding is not only about preventing physical or sexual violence.**  
It also includes **protecting emotional well-being, personal boundaries, and dignity** in everyday interactions.

Examples of safeguarding concerns can include:

- A volunteer or teacher **undermining your confidence or creating a tense atmosphere**
- Feeling **excluded or belittled** in group settings
- Someone **crossing emotional boundaries** (e.g., oversharing, invasive questions, guilt-tripping)
- Any behavior that makes you feel **unsafe, uncomfortable, or disrespected**
- Discrimination or harassment of any kind (verbal, emotional, physical, or online)

You do **not need to be sure** that something is a safeguarding issue — if it feels off or “not okay,” it’s worth mentioning.

## 🛡️ Safe & Anonymous Reporting

You can report a concern:
- **Verbally** to a trusted staff member or Safeguarding Committee member
- **Through the anonymous [report form](https://airtable.com/appbRpCtQ1p9CP6Jd/pagKhq5AcdhGlzpY4/form)** — no login or personal details required
- **Via the module feedback forms**, especially if you're unsure where to start

> **Reporting will never lead to consequences for the person raising the concern** — whether it's a misunderstanding, a small issue, or something more serious.  
>  
> You will always be treated with **respect, confidentiality, and care.**

We believe that addressing concerns **early**—even small ones—is the best way to protect everyone’s well-being.

## 🧍 For Students

As a student, you are **not responsible for judging whether something is a safeguarding issue**. Your role is simply to **speak up** when something feels off.

### ✅ You can report a concern:
- To your instructor or mentor
- To a Safeguarding Committee member
- By filling out the [report form](https://airtable.com/appbRpCtQ1p9CP6Jd/shrz8nmrNMu4K71lo)
- Anonymously, if needed

You can also use the **feedback form** after each module to raise minor concerns, even if you're unsure it's a safeguarding issue.

> _To view issues early and prevent safeguarding issues we also aim to also create a space to check in with you during some of our Saturday classes 🌱 _

## 🔎 What Happens When You Report?


### 1. Initial Evaluation (within 3 working days)
The committee assesses the risk level* (low vs. high)
You’ll be contacted with next steps (unless the report is anonymous)

### 2. Resolution Path
#### Low Risk
The Safeguarding Committee will discuss it and come to a resolution within 15 working days*
Afterwards, we will communicate the result and measures taken to the affected parties. This can be a message or a chat with you to explain the outcome and offer the space to solve any doubts.

#### High Risk
These usually require urgent action. The Safeguarding Committee meets as soon as possible to discuss possible actions.
We conduct an investigation process with all parties involved, guaranteeing privacy and respect.
The Safeguarding Committee will discuss it once more and come to a resolution.
Depending on complexity, the whole process should be resolved within 15–25 working days*.
Afterwards, we will communicate the result and measures taken to the affected parties. This can be a message or a chat with you to explain the outcome and offer the space to solve any doubts.

### 3. Reparation Measures
We want to contribute to your well-being and support you in healing. Let us know if you would benefit from additional support in processing or recovering from the safeguarding concern. We can provide psychological support, discuss adaptations or financing healing equipment when necessary.
