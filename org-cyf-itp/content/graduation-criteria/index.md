## Graduation and Course Requirements

### Graduation Criteria

These are the requirements we evaluate at the end of the course to determine if you qualify as a MigraCode graduate:

- **80%+ attendance to class.** MigraCode is a class-based course, and live sessions are compulsory.
- **100% of coursework submitted.** If you donâ€™t code, you wonâ€™t become a developer â€” and therefore we cannot promote you to hiring companies.
- **100% attendance to all individual meetings with the MigraCode Team.**
- **Active and equal participation in all team projects.** There will be 2 major team projects during the course, and each of you must actively contribute. Your collaboration will be reviewed to ensure fair and meaningful participation.
- **Functioning and deployed team projects.** Your projects must work *and* be deployed. They will be evaluated based on project-specific criteria.
- **Attendance to all compulsory events/workshops** that complement the MigraCode program.

### Course Requirements

To remain in the course during the learning period, you must comply with the following:

- **Respect all rules in our [Code of Conduct](https://syllabus.migracode.org/general-information/code-of-conduct).**
- **Maintain high attendance at all times.** Attendance is reviewed weekly. Repeated absences may lead to removal from the program.
- **Be consistently on time for class.** Repeated lateness may result in participation review.
- **Submit all coursework on time for each sprint.** Missing weekly homework is grounds for evaluation.
- **Complete your assigned work.**
- **Attend all meetings with CodeBuddies.**
- **Proactively communicate with the MigraCode team** about any unexpected situations that may affect your participation. Itâ€™s your responsibility to fulfil course requirements, and that includes informing us *before* issues escalate. Lack of communication will be considered when evaluating your progress.
