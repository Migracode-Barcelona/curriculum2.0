MigraCode is not the only organisation with a mission to train and support refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants into tech careers. Across Europe, there are several similar initiatives working toward the same goal.

**Code Your Future (CYF)** is one of those organisations, and we actively collaborate with them.

At the moment, our main collaboration is focused on building and maintaining **shared curriculum content** â€” including the very materials youâ€™re studying now.
