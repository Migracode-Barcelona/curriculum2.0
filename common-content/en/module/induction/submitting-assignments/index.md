### There are 3 types of assignments (each with their own submission methods)

### ‚úÖ 1. PR for Self Review

This exercise is **compulsory to complete**, but **you don‚Äôt need to submit it for review**.

The goal is to help you practice the full PR cycle and develop good coding and collaboration habits.

Once you‚Äôve completed the work, merge your final project into your main branch.

If you‚Äôd like extra feedback or support, you can still share your PR directly with your **CodeBuddy or other Classmates**.

‚û°Ô∏è **Example ‚Äì Help me with my kid‚Äôs homework**

- **The Backlog in the Curriculum:** [https://migracode-itp.netlify.app/onboarding/sprints/1/backlog/](https://migracode-itp.netlify.app/onboarding/sprints/1/backlog/)
- **The Issue in GitHub:** [https://github.com/Migracode-Barcelona/Module-Onboarding/issues/8](https://github.com/Migracode-Barcelona/Module-Onboarding/issues/8)



### ü§ù 2. PR with CodeBuddy Review
