We call problems that stop our progress "blockers". We talk through our blockers regularly and help each other get "unblocked" or "unstuck".

{{<note title="Sharing Our Blockers" type="activity">}}
Join our [Jamboard here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGuKbmnAlI/D3xfJskwMG2hFNWlUI6Y9Q/edit) or grab some sticky notes. Add your blockers.

Make sure to add only one blocker per note.

Once everyone has added their blockers, group similar blockers together.
{{</note>}}

Next, we will discuss the blockers and help each other get "unblocked".
