Welcome, everyone. This workshop is your first set of technical **“glasses”** — you’ll learn to see a website like a developer. That means using curiosity and observation to understand how interfaces work and where to find information.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Once you start seeing like a developer, you can’t unsee it! You might find it harder to look at websites as a regular user — which is, ironically, who we design them for.

### ⚙️ Requirements
This workshop runs entirely on **GitHub**.  
You will need:
- A **GitHub account**
- Internet access  

That’s all — it’s beginner friendly. Before starting, make sure you can access the repository above.  
Form groups of up to **five people**, and set a timer to keep track of time.

---

### ✍️ Exercise 1 – *Eat Me, Drink Me* (10 min)

Start by finding and reading the **README** file.  
Ask yourselves:
- Where is the `README` located?
- What’s its purpose?
- What’s the repository about?

> 💡 **Key takeaway:** Don’t skip over text. Read it carefully — it often holds the answers.


### ✍️ Exercise 2 – *You’ve Got Issues* (20 min)

Next, explore the **Issues** tab. All your coursework is managed there, so understanding it is essential.

Try the following:
- Find where issues are listed.  
- Look at the labels — what story do they tell about how work is organized?  
- Hover over labels to reveal extra info.  
- Create a new issue: what options do you notice (assignees, labels, templates, etc.)?  
- Make sure you understand what the repository’s goals are. How can you find that out?  
- Look at the deployed site to identify what might be wrong or missing.

**Challenge:** Can you figure out *who decides what the labels mean*?  
Check discussions, docs, or existing issues for hints.  

End by sharing **one key takeaway** from your group.



### ✍️ Exercise 3 – *Pull Requests* (20 min)

Time to explore how code changes are tracked and discussed through **Pull Requests (PRs)**.  
Move slowly and read every part of the PR interface together.

Focus on:
- Where can you see all PRs in the repo?  
- Open one PR and read it from top to bottom.  
- What’s the story behind it? What changed — and why?  
- Where can you view the **file changes**?  
- How can you filter them?  
- Where is the **conversation** happening (comments, reviews)?  

Write down one insight or question that stood out.

### ✍️ Solo Challenge – *Hidden Powers* (5 min)

Now explore on your own. Play, click, test.  
Try these shortcuts and tricks:
- What happens when you press `/` or `t`?
- Can you find other keyboard shortcuts?
- What search tools are available?
- How can you instantly find a word on the page?

Wrap up by sharing your most surprising discovery with your group.



## 📝 Final Thoughts

There’s **no single correct path** through this workshop — the goal is to develop your own way of exploring and understanding interfaces.  
Stay curious, keep experimenting, and share what you learn with others.  
That’s how developers see the world — one insight at a time. 🌱
