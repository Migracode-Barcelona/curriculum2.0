If we're expecting to get help with our problems in class, we need to have run into those problems before class.

Different people have different schedules - they may work different days or nights, or have other responsibilities.

To solve this problem, we use the **rhythm of the week**.

This rhythm supports MC students to plan their work during the week while still allowing flexibility in people‚Äôs different schedules. In a typical sprint week,¬†Monday is the starting point¬†with in-person sessions on¬†Saturdays. We use Sundays and Mondays to reflect on our learning and finish off any backlog tasks.
