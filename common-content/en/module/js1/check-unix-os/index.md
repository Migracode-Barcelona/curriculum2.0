MigraCode does not support Windows.

We have found that we don't reliably have volunteers at class who can debug Windows problems, and they frequently come up, stopping trainees from making progress.

We do not support Windows so as to not waste lots of trainee and volunteer time. We have made this decision even though Windows is a popular operating system and has features like WSL which help to get experience with Unix.
{{</note>}}

If you have a Mac or Linux machine already, you already have a UNIX based operating system. All MC-supplied laptops run Mac OS or Linux. If you have your own machine and it runs Windows, you need to set up a Linux partition. â€¦If you have your own machine and runs Windows:
1. Ask MigraCode to provide with a laptop (Linux or Mac OS)
2. If MigraCode doesnâ€™t have any available laptops, you will need to set up a Linux partition.
If you need help doing this, send a message in slack so some volunteers can try to help you with it.
