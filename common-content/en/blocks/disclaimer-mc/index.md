{{<note title="">}}

This exercise is hosted on the GitHub repository of our partner NGO, **Code Your Future** (UK), and **not** on a MigraCode-owned repository. We are part of a European network where we share resources and support each other as we share the same mission - to provide free, high-quality tech education to our communities.

The exercise works as intended — you are free to **fork and clone** the repository as usual, if required by the exercise. However, please do **not make any pull requests to the original Code Your Future repository**.

Lastly, if there are any **mentions to CYF Slack channels** please write a message into our **MigraCode class channel** instead.
